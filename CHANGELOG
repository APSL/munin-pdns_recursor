1.03 -- 2009-12-11

   * I had missed one "seconds" reference in querylatency graph, converted
     back to "usec".

1.02 -- 2009-12-11

   * Changing the colors in the Exceptions graph.

   * Removing the usec to sec conversion.

1.01 -- 2009-12-10

   Changes based on review from Nicolai Langfeldt:

      * The pdns_rec_answers plugin has non-mnemonic data series names.  If
        anyone wants to make a ".max" override and then gets back to
        it later it's not immediately obvious what the override is for.
        IMHO unfortunate.

      * pdns_rec_cache_size should probably use AREA/STACK or LINE/STACK to
        visualize the total cache size.

      * You probably want to use DERIVE rather than COUNTER in most places.
        http://munin.projects.linpro.no/wiki/fieldname.type

      * RRD scales SI units so that if pdns_rec_querylatency reports time in
        seconds then RRD will show in ms or s or even kilo-seconds as
        apropriate.  If you want to keep it in "ms" you probably also want
        to do "graph_scale no" to avoid seeing kilo-ms in the graph :-)

      * You can use .colour XXXXXX (RGB colour hex without the leading #) to
        specify the drawing colour for plugins where that gives right
        associations when viewing, e.g. maybe use red or yellow in the
        pdns_rec_throttle plugin.

      * Configurable rec_control path
