INSTALLING

   Copy the pdns_rec* files to /etc/munin/plugins

   Set up plugins to run as root (rec_control has to run as root, not pdns,
   not munin, graphs won't update if this is not set):

      echo '[pdns_rec_*]' >/etc/munin/plugin-conf.d/pdns_rec
      echo 'user root' >>/etc/munin/plugin-conf.d/pdns_rec

   Re-start munin-node.

NON-DEFAULT REC_CONTROL PATH

   There is a configuration value called "rec_control" which can be set to
   the path to the rec_control program.  The default for this is
   /usr/bin/rec_control.

   For example, in the plugin-conf you can do:

      [pdns_rec_*]
      user root
      rec_control /usr/local/bin/rec_control
